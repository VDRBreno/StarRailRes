Helektra... when your song ends, where will you swim to next?\"\nWhen futile hopes shatter, she always answers their questions with a solitary melody, yet it enchants all who hear it.\nOr perhaps... whether in the mortal realm or the deep sea, the only true listener is the performer herself.","icon":"icon/light_cone/23047.png","preview":"image/light_cone_preview/23047.png","portrait":"image/light_cone_portrait/23047.png","ranks":{"id":"23047","skill":"Solo","desc":"Increases the wearer's Effect Hit Rate by #1[i]%.
