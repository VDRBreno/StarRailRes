He wished the geniuses of the Society could come together and happily converse about their lives, loves, and dreams. For that purpose, he invented \"Society Tickets\" and designed an entire system that ensured every new Society member would receive this ticket even after his death. This ticket would instantly teleport the user to a specific dimension decked with festivities. The truth is that every new member after #56 had indeed used their Society Ticket, but not a single one of them had used it at the same time as someone else.","icon":"icon/curio/1012.png"}
