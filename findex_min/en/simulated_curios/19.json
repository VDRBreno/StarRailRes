{"id":"19","name":"Record from Beyond the Sky","desc":"Upon entering battle, all allies will nullify all DMG received except for DoT until after they are attacked, and cannot be debuffed for 3 turn(s).","bg_desc":"The Beyond the Sky Choir lost their faith when Ena the Order was absorbed by Xipe. The once-solemn chords fell silent and the stars turned mute. Only a few records, made by the Choir's devoted audiences remain in this world today. When these records are placed within specific phonographs, you will hear songs from the end of the universe, sounds that contain the beauty of Order. The last Phonograph of Order was destroyed in the Emperor's War, and now the thick layer of dust on the records are protests to that soundless era.","icon":"icon/curio/1031.png"}
