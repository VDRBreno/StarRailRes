{"id":"59","name":"Insect Web","desc":"Upon entering battle, the character currently with the highest ATK will become Parasitized. While Parasitized, the character's ATK increases by 50%, but will lose HP equal to 20% of their current HP at the start of every turn. When this character is knocked down, Parasitized will be transferred to a random character.","bg_desc":"The Armed Archaeologists had repeatedly reported on the dangers they met in the wild. They had encountered a never-ending stretch of insect webbings deep inside a nest, with the decaying shed skins of worms, tens of thousands of egg sacks, and various secretions stuck to it. Touching this web carries a high risk of becoming infected by the parasitic larvae. Once, a parasitized Armed Archaeologist steeled themselves and sliced out larvae from underneath the skin of their arm with a knife in order to deliver data to the Intelligentsia Guild for research purposes. The academic world gave this act high praises and devoted much research into it, coming to the conclusion that these creatures are very likely the descendants of Tayzzyronth, the Imperator Insectorum.","icon":"icon/curio/1019.png"}
