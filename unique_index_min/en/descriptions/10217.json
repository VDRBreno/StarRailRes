{"id":"10217","title":"\"Flying Aureus\"","desc":"The spirit granted by the Reignbow Arbiter, a beast of divine speed hidden within the flesh of \"The Merlin's Claw\" Feixiao. \nThe eyes of mortals cannot perceive it. Only in the fleeting moment when beings at death's door are briefly frozen in time can the gazes of mere humans witness its descent.\nFor Feixiao, it is the arrow that guides her actions, the death that pursues and devours her life, and the prey she is chasing throughout her existence."}
