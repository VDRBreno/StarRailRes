On account of her fantastic friendship with Ruan Mei, she once made a drink — to which she gave an eye-catching name taken from the title of her favorite ancient Amber Era music — as a gift to the other woman. The drink Yu Qingtu concocted, named the Pinkest Collision, was proven to be non-toxic, but a mixologist once spent days trying to recreate its formula, seeking to prove that the beverage was made from various insect carcasses, insect spores, carapaces, and phosphorous — he concluded that this drink may possess hallucinogenic qualities.","icon":"icon/curio/1060.png"}
