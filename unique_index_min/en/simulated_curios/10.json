{"id":"10","name":"Mechanical Cuckoo Clock","desc":"Upon your next entry into the Simulated Universe, you will get a random 2-star Blessing.","bg_desc":"After the Second Rubert Rebellion, the IPC had once planned a brutal extermination of all mechanical life across the Cosmos. Fortunately, before the plan was passed, the IPC heard that #76 Screwllum was selected by Nous to join the Genius Society. The IPC then made this mechanical cuckoo clock as a gift to appease the new genius. This gift is very unremarkable in today's view, but that was an era when mechanical beings were persecuted. The birth of the mechanical cuckoo clock itself is a symbol of peace.","icon":"icon/curio/1010.png"}
