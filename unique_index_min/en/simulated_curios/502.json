{"id":"502","name":"Metallic Gear Ring","desc":"","bg_desc":"Due to the influence of History Fictionologists, the end of #Rubert II has always remained enigmatic. Some references wrote that the second emperor's organic body ultimately hindered him from completing the empire's great work, as he died from illness on the cast-iron throne. Some poets warbled that a lady in a pastel-colored silk dress sauntered into the capital, and the empire collapsed in a cacophony. Other voices lamented that the metallic ring pricked his finger, and so the riotous machine killed the organic before him. Some plays also dramatized that he suddenly expressed his profound feelings and shed human tears as if he suddenly became free, then slowly closed his eyes before his subjects, never to open them again.","icon":"icon/curio/1138.png"}
