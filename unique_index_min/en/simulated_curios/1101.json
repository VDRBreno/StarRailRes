These songs of praise resembled divine blessings and their melody were not limited to the form of the traditional octave, with their harmonies creating ever-new combinations, never duplicating. The Beyond the Sky Choir revered how this melody infinitely varied and yet always stayed within the realms of \"Order,\" thus seeking to create a Triangular Drum-roll Device to replicate this infinite spectrum of notes.","icon":"icon/curio/1033.png"}
