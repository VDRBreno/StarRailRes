When choosing your Blessings after winning a battle, there is a greatly increased chance for Blessings of Destruction to appear","bg_desc":"There is a saying amongst the dejected Self-Annihilators that the universe has no purpose and humans are nothing in the eyes of the Aeons.

To show the Self-Annihilators that the Aeons do care, the Doctors of Chaos combined the demon god crafts of the occult monks to create the Sealing Wax of Aeons. It is said that stamping with this Sealing Wax will attract a glimpse from the corresponding Aeon from across space and time â€” There are no successful examples yet, but some Self-Annihilators did regain their faith in the universe, Aeons, and everything else after stamping with this sealing wax.","icon":"icon/curio/1023.png"}
