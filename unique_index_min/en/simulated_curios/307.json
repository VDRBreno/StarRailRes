This Curio will be destroyed after its effect has been triggered 4 times, and the Max HP bonus will take effect even after the Curio is destroyed.","bg_desc":"In the Black Forest, a sponge miraculously became sapient. It tried to interact with the similarly sapient screws, but found itself hitting a brick wall. It pondered about its painful experience and learned to smooth away all the edges in its personality, allowing itself to constantly shine and climb up the societal ladder, ultimately turning into a smooth and slick sponge. Now, it dedicates its efforts to uplifting discarded sponges into developing their own self-awareness.","icon":"icon/curio/1072.png"}
