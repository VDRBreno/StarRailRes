{"id":"3203","name":"\"Jellyfish on the Staircase\"","desc":"Loses all Dice reroll attempts. Making a reroll will no longer consume a reroll attempt. If the same Dice Face is rolled more than once in a single turn, this Curio will be destroyed.","bg_desc":"The Riddlers have a saying: Every time that an enigma manifests in the universe, it will leave behind a \"staircase\" in the void. The dissolved realities will then drip down the steps, condensing into a mottled thing bearing semblance to a jellyfish. There was once a Nameless who claimed to have made contact with a \"Jellyfish on the Staircase.\" In madness, he proclaimed that the jellyfish will activate the cognition regions within the gray matter of one's brain â€” a vast place beyond the fathoming of mortal minds.","icon":"icon/curio/1081.png"}
