{"id":"20","name":"Entropic Die","desc":"Randomly Enhances 2 Blessing(s) immediately after obtaining this Curio","bg_desc":"Entropic Dice are common in the universe and cause countless tiny but malevolent disturbances. To use it, you grab the die tightly and think of any meaningful sentence in your head, then as you throw the die, think about the food you want to eat the most. You will receive unexpected wealth if the die lands on a certain number and wonderful love on another number, but the ends you will meet for other numbers include illness, bad luck, curses, and lifelong rain. Despite this, many people still love to play with these dice, and happily declare that these items are just a joke made by the Masked Fools.","icon":"icon/curio/1034.png"}
