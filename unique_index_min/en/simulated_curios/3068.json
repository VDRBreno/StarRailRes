They traverse the internet and use a technology known as aether editing to alter reality, making life into a great game. Occasionally, the cream of the crop among them gets to soar away from the planet and use the vast Cosmos as the second stage beyond the tutorial area. This cassette tape records the story of a legendary hacker. His life began in Punklorde's underground water reservoirs and ended in the company of the Galaxy Rangers.
