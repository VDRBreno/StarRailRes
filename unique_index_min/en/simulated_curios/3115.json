{"id":"3115","name":"Fool's Mask","desc":"All Blessings in possession are swapped to random Blessings with their Enhancement levels retained, with a chance of being replaced by Blessings of higher rarity","bg_desc":"The mask of the Masked Fools is symbol toward their faith in the Elation, and wearing said mask is effectively an admission ticket when they gather at the tavern at the edge of the world. These masks are made of heavy material, are vibrant in color, and with a maniacal smile yet with surprisingly intricate brushstrokes, as if waiting for each playful prank. They bear the devout certification of the Masked Fools, but it seems like they were all stolen from the ship of the Mourning Actors.","icon":"icon/curio/1067.png"}
