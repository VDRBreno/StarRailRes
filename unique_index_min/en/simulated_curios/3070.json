{"id":"3070","name":"IPC Cuckoo Clock","desc":"Increases Cosmic Fragments required to Enhance and reset Blessings by 25%","bg_desc":"The IPC's initial Prototype Cuckoo Clock represents the beginning of Operation Cuckoo Clock. Many are curious why Operation Cuckoo Clock was conceived â€” Louis Fleming declared that the worship of Qlipoth, Aeon of Preservation, means the IPC needs to protect its hard-won presence. In his speech, he stated that while the Interastral Peace Corporation is now the master of the universe's finances, it still needs to remain vigilant against the catastrophe of Finality. That is why he advocated the creation of the cuckoo clock series to collect information regarding that Aeon, meticulously removing any possibility of the IPC becoming bankrupt or disbanded in its future cosmic journey.","icon":"icon/curio/1039.png"}
