{"id":"3117","name":"Spirit of the Knights of Beauty","desc":"Gains 4 dice reroll(s) after obtaining this Curio","bg_desc":"The faction that likes dealing with the Knights of Beauty the most are most likely the Masked Fools. These Fools like to amuse themselves by exploiting the knights' faith in the eventual return of Idrila, while the knights themselves remain ever-pious and obstinate practitioners in the ways of Beauty. Due to the reasons listed above, the Mourning Actors developed a sense of empathy for the knights from the spirit they demonstrated, and they collected a tooth sacrificed by the Knights of Beauty in their practice of seeking aesthetic perfection, with the tooth's desirability enduring even till the present.","icon":"icon/curio/1051.png"}
