{"id":"3212","name":"\"Cognito Invalidater\" Codebuilder","desc":"When entering battle, characters lose Energy equal to their Max Energy","bg_desc":"\"When will the human race become machines? And when will machines become human?\" Following the machine era calendar, on this day at three in the afternoon, the invasive \"Cognito Invalidater\" entered the mind of a certain organic individual in the Mechanical City. At the start, he was helpless against the uncontrolled thoughts in his own mind. Then, he realized writing notes could help him effectively counter the anxiety and meaninglessness the \"Cognito Invalidater\" inflicted on him. So he began to write, spewing forth words, expelling the chaotic and incoherent noises in his head that remained deafening loud despite being bereft of substance. He produced lines and lines of error code. This eventually drew the Riddlers' attention.","icon":"icon/curio/1071.png"}
