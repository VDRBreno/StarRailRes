{"id":"306","name":"Rotting Fruit of the Alien Tree","desc":"Characters will resist all effects that cause them to be inflicted with Crowd Control debuffs. Every time they resist a debuff, they will consume HP equal to 20% of their Max HP","bg_desc":"The Elixir Seekers once found a rotten Fruit of the Alien Tree. The color of its skin was already odd, having shifted from a faint yellow to powdery blue. To understand the pharmacology behind this fruit, a pair of Elixir Seeker twins separately ingested a normal Fruit of the Alien Tree and a rotten version. One of them immediately welcomed metamorphosis while the other instantly perished - But because there was no third party present, no one could confirm which twin survived, or which fruit he consumed.","icon":"icon/curio/1073.png"}
