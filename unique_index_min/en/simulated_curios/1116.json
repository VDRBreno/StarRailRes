{"id":"1116","name":"Vile Mechanical Satellite #900","desc":"Reduces the prices for shop items in Transaction Domains by 30%","bg_desc":"The Charon-Targin System Alliance's economic operations are supported by the sale of their two types of thought-altering devices. Should the outside wish to reach the alliance, they must pass through the neural pathways of a titanic Intellitron life form. It is said that the Charon-Targin System Alliance is hostile to all organic life, and is a very typical anti-organic civilization in the ruthless tactics it employs against its foes. Of their many instruments of ruination, Satellite #900 stands among the vilest of them all. However, the satellite was ultimately disregarded by the denizens of the Charon-Targin Alliance due to its obvious and proud mechanical visage which integrated poorly with the populace who had taken to disguising themselves as organics.","icon":"icon/curio/1050.png"}
