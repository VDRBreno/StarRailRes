{"id":"1006","name":"Ambergris Cheese","desc":"After winning a battle, all allies restore HP equal to 30% of their respective Max HP","bg_desc":"Once upon a time, a helper robot turned Ambergris of Abundance into cheese on a whim to satisfy its little master's seemingly never-ending appetite. Unexpectedly, the Ambergris Cheese started to multiply on its own. The helper robot and the master worked at full speed, but their digestion still could not keep up with how fast the cheese was multiplying. Therefore, they had to ask for help from a group of passing Mourning Actors and escaped to another world on a gondola. That one world in the cosmos is still stuffed full of delicious cheese to the day, packed so tight that not a single centimeter of space is left. The story teaches an important lesson about not wasting food.","icon":"icon/curio/1006.png"}
