{"id":"1021","name":"Shining Trapezohedron Die","desc":"Replaces all Curios currently in possession (including this Curio) with random Curios","bg_desc":"This die has irregular sides and a wondrous light that twirls unrestrained within it. It is said to be the seal of a horrible and indescribable evil god, and one must avoid contact with it in dark places at all costs. Some people did not believe in the above myth and insisted on staying in a dark room with the die, only to find that the light within the die itself cannot be blocked out. That is how the famous Shining Trapezohedron Die Paradox came to be â€” You cannot prove something that cannot be proven.","icon":"icon/curio/1021.png"}
