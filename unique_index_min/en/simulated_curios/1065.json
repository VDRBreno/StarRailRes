{"id":"1065","name":"Divination Cuckoo Clock","desc":"When selecting Blessings after victory, the number of available Blessings will be reduced by 1","bg_desc":"Every day at dawn, this cuckoo clock will spit out a piece of paper with poetry written on it. All the sentences in the poems are composed of jargon from ancient mathematical systems. Some believe these poems to be prophetic and claim to be close to deciphering them, only for the clock to suddenly disappear. The possibility of foretelling the future is already priceless, and everyone is hoping for the clock to once again be circulated in the market. If that ever happened, all the riches of the universe would pour towards the clock â€” But there are also those who think it is only an artistic cuckoo clock designed to be good at writing poems.","icon":"icon/curio/1065.png"}
