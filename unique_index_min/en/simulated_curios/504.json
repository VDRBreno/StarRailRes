{"id":"504","name":"Kill That Butterfly","desc":"","bg_desc":"The process of annihilating a chaotic system is like making a specimen. Pin the information on every particle on the board and still the wings, then bind the butterfly's path and make reality dance in the way you want it to. Any tiny change would instantly disintegrate the fragile balance. No matter how much the scholars continue to perfect the model, they could only consider the foolish act of unifying the pattern of movement as the hubris of mortals. Therefore, I still clearly remember the first day I killed the butterfly, even though it was so long ago. I remember how the point of the knife stabbed into its chest.","icon":"icon/curio/1135.png"}
