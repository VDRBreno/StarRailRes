At the same time, their SPD increases by 5%, up to 5 times","bg_desc":"Yu Qingtu, Genius Society's #55, has a predilection for giving cocktails gaudy names. Some among them might even have names with special implications, connected to stories known only to a few â€” stories such as the Thalan Toxi-Flame, which exists on record as one of the 774 most toxic cocktails. Records show that in the Aterlexian System, the Thalan Toxi-Flame was once extremely popular among the locals, with each of the locals that sampled its taste no longer able to describe the flavors thereafter. The Pepeshi people, imbued with acute olfactory senses, would use their understanding of the beverage to their benefit and introduced other counterfeit drinks such as the Thalan Mysti-Flame, the Thalan Hydro-Flame, and the Thalan Detoxi-Flame to the cosmos, with each of them being entirely harmless and alcohol-free.","icon":"icon/curio/1062.png"}
