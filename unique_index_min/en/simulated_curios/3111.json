{"id":"3111","name":"Tonic of Efficacious Chaos","desc":"Increases DMG dealt by characters' Techniques by 200%. Technique DMG further increases by 200% of the Technique's respective character's Max HP","bg_desc":"The Doctors of Chaos can't see the point when it comes to meaningless demonstrations of rebelliousness. They once placed the fang of an Inquisition Spirit, Baviru mucus, and the blood of a wandering devil within a Tonic of Efficacious Chaos before touching it to the head of a telepathic spider to seal the tonic's opening. The Doctors of Chaos believe that this tonic can work wonders when treating a patient's loneliness, but it also makes them grow increasingly hostile toward the doctors at the end of the process. Its side effects can commonly cause Self-Annihilators to behold the \"Shadow of Nihility.\"","icon":"icon/curio/1056.png"}
