{"id":"315","name":"\"Revelrous\" Rainbowmaker","desc":"Bringing this Curio into an Adventure Domain will decrease the domain's time limit by 30%","bg_desc":"Following the machine era calendar, on this day at six in the morning, the invasive \"Revelrous\" entered the mind of a mono-horned beast in the Mechanical City. Only paltry few unmodified animals remained in the city. Hence, fueled by the \"Revelrous\" contagion, the mono-horned beast was able to overcome all manner of despairing defeats, awkward incidents, and crippling moments of dread. Sadness became joy for it, pain became pleasure, and pressure became a trigger for secreting excitatory neurotransmitters â€” Until one day it realized it had taught itself how to convert \"mood\" into a freely adjustable parameter. Thereafter, its confidence was perpetually high and unshakable, turning it into a \"Rainbow-Radiant Unicorn.\"","icon":"icon/curio/1075.png"}
