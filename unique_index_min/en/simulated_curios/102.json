When the interstellar communication network was just being established and the supply of antennas fell short of demand, the IPC quickly recognized the latent need for this item in the cosmic market. An ingenious plan was born: Since silver's exceptional malleability allowed it to be stretched from one gram into yards of antenna, a researcher devised a Silver Coin of Discord that split itself infinitely, dramatically increasing the quantity of silver available to meet demands. The IPC then melted these coins into antennas and exported them throughout various star systems, enormously advancing interplanetary communications.","icon":"icon/curio/1045.png"}
