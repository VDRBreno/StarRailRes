{"id":"673480","name":"Winged Tiger","desc":"After ally targets use an attack, apply \"Fearful Tremble\" equal to their \"Critical Boost\" stack to an attacked target with the highest \"Fearful Tremble\" stacks. Every stack of \"Fearful Tremble\" reduces enemy targets' DMG dealt by 0.5%. When reaching 50 stack(s), it deals Wind DMG equal to 3500% of base DMG and loses 20 stack(s), then increases the enemy's CRIT DMG taken by 150% for 3 turn(s). When the enemy target takes action, they obtain all \"Fearful Tremble\" on the field. When they are defeated, \"Fearful Tremble\" will be applied to the enemy target with the highest current stacks.","enhanced_desc":""}
