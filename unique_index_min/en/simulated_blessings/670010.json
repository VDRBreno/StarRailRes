{"id":"670010","name":"City Restorer","desc":"Comet Nucleus appears in the Action Order: Each time it takes a turn, absorbs all allies' Shields, reducing their values to 1, and turning the absorbed values into its own Shield. Then, it deals Physical DMG equal to 2500% of its Shield value plus 1000% base DMG to all enemies, with a 75% base chance to Freeze enemies for 1 turn(s). When characters take damage, Comet Nucleus's Shield will be consumed first. When Quake DMG is triggered, 70% of Comet Nucleus's Shield will be considered as the character's Shield.","enhanced_desc":""}
