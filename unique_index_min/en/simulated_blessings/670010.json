{"id":"670010","name":"City Restorer","desc":"Comet Nucleus appears in the Action Order: Each time it takes a turn, absorbs all allies' Shields, reducing their values to 1 and turning the absorbed values into its own Shield. Afterward, it deals Physical DMG equal to 2500% of this value to all enemies, with a 75% base chance to Freeze enemies for 1 turn(s). When characters take damage, Comet Nucleus's Shield will be consumed first. When characters deal Quake DMG, 50% of Comet Nucleus's Shield will be considered as the character's Shield.","enhanced_desc":""}
