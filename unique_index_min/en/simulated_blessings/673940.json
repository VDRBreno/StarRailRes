{"id":"673940","name":"Gate of Yactor","desc":"After an ally target uses an attack, there is a 60% fixed chance to add 1 Weakness of a random Type to a random attack target, prioritizing Weakness Type that the enemy target does not already have. The applied Weakness is removed after the enemy target is Weakness Broken. After adding a weakness to an enemy target, applies 5 stacks of \"Harmonize\" to the enemy target and records the added Weakness once. This effect can only trigger up to 2 time(s) per action. When any enemy target is Weakness Broken, based on the recorded weaknesses, each record deals 250% of Break effect of corresponding Type to the target and adjacent targets.","enhanced_desc":""}
