Upon reaching 50 stacks, they enter the \"Dirge\" state. When a character in the \"Dirge\" state launches an attack, they consume 16 Charge stacks to deal 3 instances of \"Aftertaste\" DMG equal to 150% of their Max HP to the attacked enemy target. The state ends when Charge stacks reach 0. Charge stacks can still be accumulated while in the \"Dirge\" state.","enhanced_desc":""}
