Tomorrow, he would lead the Kremnoan Detachment forth once again, migrating to foreign lands.\nWhere this wandering would end, he did not know. The only certainty was this — he would bear the duty of a king until the blood and flames consumed him.\nAs night deepened, he drank the bloodwine alone. A passing bard plucked at his strings, a wandering melody drifting through the air—\n\"Home is the land of dreams, not a place one can ever reach.\"","icon":"icon/light_cone/23039.png","preview":"image/light_cone_preview/23039.png","portrait":"image/light_cone_portrait/23039.png"}
