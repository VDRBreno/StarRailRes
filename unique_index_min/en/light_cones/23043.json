{"id":"23043","name":"Lies Dance on the Breeze","rarity":5,"path":"Warlock","desc":"The cat-eared girl stretches her limbs atop the rooftop, slinking into the night.\nIn the treasure vault that had slumbered for a thousand years, she glides effortlessly, gathering precious treasures into her embrace before vanishing without a sound.\n\"Foolish fate could never catch me!\"\nThe wind through the ruins carries the scent of the wild, rustling her hood.\nResting her head against the cold stone, she swallows a bite of rough, dry rations, idly tossing a gold coin between her fingers.\nA faint sound from afar reaches her ears. In that holy city bathed in dawn's light, the bustling crowds still revel in warmth and celebration.\n\"How much longer... a year, or ten thousand?\"\nShe stretches with a lazy yawn, casting her restless thoughts aside.\n\"Hah, Cifera always has the last laugh!\"\nA golden streak of lightning cuts across the sky, and her proclamation lingers in the windâ€”\nJust as it had a thousand years ago.","icon":"icon/light_cone/23043.png","preview":"image/light_cone_preview/23043.png","portrait":"image/light_cone_portrait/23043.png"}
