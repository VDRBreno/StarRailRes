{"id":"23046","name":"The Hell Where Ideals Burn","rarity":5,"path":"Rogue","desc":"The flames of karma ignite the plains. The ideals of unknowns turn to ashes, as the ideals of others burn passionately.\nThe Guardian traverses between bullets and arrowheads.\nHe can save no one here. He can save everyone here.\nKill one person to save one person. Kill ten thousand to save ten thousand. The fate of trampling over our peers is one part of humanity's continued existence.\nThe Guardian had already grown used to all this, and his steps never hesitated.\nThe determination that covers his legs is like wind. The determination that covers his arms is like fire.\nHe is still seeking a miracle that can bring forth salvation.","icon":"icon/light_cone/23046.png","preview":"image/light_cone_preview/23046.png","portrait":"image/light_cone_portrait/23046.png"}
