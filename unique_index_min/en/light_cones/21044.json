She takes the other person's hand, her smile beaming into those indifferent eyes.\n\"Beautiful Ranger... Welcome to the stage of the Remembrance. At this proximity... you are far more enchanting than one might perceive.\"\nThe surroundings darken, a beam of light cascading from the dome above, tracing their evolving steps.\n\"However, some were meant to dance with us but have yet to arrive...\"\nIn a spinning moment, she draws closer to that expressionless face, grips that cold hand, and softly inquires—\n\"Tell me. What have you done?\"\nAs their dance steps grow hurried more and more, fragmented snippets of the past rush into her mind through their joined fingertips.\nIn a past that stretches back further and further, she hears the sound of rain and the lamentations just before life's extinguish. Then, she sees her dance partner holding a blood-red paper umbrella in the drizzling rain. Finally, as far as her eyes can see—\nA field of drowned corpses bobbing in the deluge.\nPanic-stricken, she tries to withdraw her hand, falling backward.\nThe surroundings brighten again, the banquet's clamor resurfacing. Her dance partner gently supports her waist, as if oblivious to the ordeal that just unfolded.\n\"What a lovely dance that was, Memokeeper. Shall we have another go?\"","icon":"icon/light_cone/21044.png","preview":"image/light_cone_preview/21044.png","portrait":"image/light_cone_portrait/21044.png"}
