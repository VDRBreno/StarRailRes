{"id":"23024","name":"Along the Passing Shore","rarity":5,"path":"Warlock","desc":"Flowing in the narrow border between \"existence\" and \"nothingness,\" the ice-cold tides eternally lap against the shores and bring all things to their final end.\nIn this place, the drowned ask for help, lament with songs, find their happiness, enjoy sweet moments, and suffer great agony... All these are reflected in the water. She cannot experience these, but she can feel them —\nThere are still many roads to walk, many sounds to listen to, and many things to change before she arrives at the end.\nShe reaches out and saves the drowning from the temptations of Nihility, and one mirage after another bursts apart behind her figure.\nShe keeps walking in this boundless world, all for an end that does not exist.\n— And it's always raining here.","icon":"icon/light_cone/23024.png","preview":"image/light_cone_preview/23024.png","portrait":"image/light_cone_portrait/23024.png"}
