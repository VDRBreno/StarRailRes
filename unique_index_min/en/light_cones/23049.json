A cozy Express, companions each with their unique personalities, dazzling and magnificent planets... like a dream too beautiful to leave behind.\n\"My real journey starts now!\"\nThe girl's declaration seems to whisper right beside her ear.\nShe gazes toward the distant starry sky, as a beam of light approaches.\nIt's the Express's headlight, like a shooting star.\n\"Good night, March... When you awaken, continue on your Trailblaze journey ♭\"\nAs the memoria tide surges, she buries her wish deep in her heart, those tiny whispers and that light\n—she has never forgotten.","icon":"icon/light_cone/23049.png","preview":"image/light_cone_preview/23049.png","portrait":"image/light_cone_portrait/23049.png"}
