Is she?\" The girl caresses the unfamiliar self.\nShe recalls how the fire that day had swallowed her whole, and how her bejeweled fan turned into ash.\nShe had once walked on a never-ending road, looking for the light ahead.\nThe sounds outside were calling for her, leading her forward, guiding her through the layers of night.\nThe sounds within reminded her of those unfulfilled promises, unexecuted plans, and unrealized wishes... They were all still waiting for her.\nThey never dissipated in the fire, but instead, glowed ever brighter in the flames.\n\"That is me...\"\nShe stands at the end of the road and no longer looks back in reminiscence â€”\n\"It's the original me, and also the brand-new me.\"","icon":"icon/light_cone/23035.png","preview":"image/light_cone_preview/23035.png","portrait":"image/light_cone_portrait/23035.png"}
