Tentacles extend from the Sea of Souls, as if intending to toy with that floating, fragile life.\nThe broken limbs of the sea beast hammer giant sprays skyward, and sink into the oceanic abyss after shattering like rubble.\nThey say that the roar of the fight lasted for ten days and nights, overwhelming even the thunder and lightning.\nThey say that even if a man had ten thousand lives, he would not be enough to resist the Sea of Souls's erosion.\nThen, courage washes away the immaturity and cold pride tempered timidity â€”\nAnd that thin figure stumbled onto the shore. The first ray of the morning sun shines down upon the sea's waters, dyeing it red like past blood.","icon":"icon/light_cone/21058.png","preview":"image/light_cone_preview/21058.png","portrait":"image/light_cone_portrait/21058.png"}
