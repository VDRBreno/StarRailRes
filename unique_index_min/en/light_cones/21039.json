She simulates fate's hand in how it manipulates all variables for the masses, seeking the trajectory of truth beneath the visage of a disorderly exterior.\nFinally, when all the characters are in their place, she brushes over the card faces that are in stasis and assembles the unfathomable truth.\n\"Still missing a card... So, I'll add one in.\"","icon":"icon/light_cone/21039.png","preview":"image/light_cone_preview/21039.png","portrait":"image/light_cone_portrait/21039.png"}
