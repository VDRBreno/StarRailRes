Two lightning-quick figures slaughter their way out of combat.\n\"I alone will be enough to handle them.\"\nEvery punch unleashed by the warrior sends spears of blood through the bodies of the enemy.\n\"Brute force and nothing more. Watch my blade!\"\nAs a blade of pale silver slices in a curve, monsters drop like falling leaves.\n\"A contest of speed?\"\nThe two charge at the other side simultaneously.\nHowls of anguish sound as the stealthy beasts behind them are struck down at once.\nTwo voices can be heard at the same time.\n\"That was my kill!\"","icon":"icon/light_cone/21050.png","preview":"image/light_cone_preview/21050.png","portrait":"image/light_cone_portrait/21050.png"}
