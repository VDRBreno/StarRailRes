{"id":"23031","name":"I Venture Forth to Hunt","rarity":5,"path":"Rogue","desc":"\"Pitiful, laughable slaves...\"\nThe Denizens of Abundance's legions come crashing upon the border like an avalanche, with Lupitoxin rushing toward the Verdant Knights like a tide, trying to arouse the deep-set fear hidden in the soldiers' hearts. Illusions of dread came forth, striking the wills of the warriors, compelling them to drop their blades and be seized by hesitation.\nBut the front remains stalwart like a bronze wall, unstirred by the borisins' disdainful words. From among the soldiers, a single figure saunters forth.\nShe moves her body at a slow pace, and the flags behind her rustle under the unseen killing intent.\n\"The general... it's the general...\"\n\"General Feixiao...\"\n\"The Merlin's Claw!\"\nThese small cheers and calls then come together into a thunderous battle cry.\n\"Always soaring! Forever triumphant!\"\nShe stands there, alone. A single figure, but imbued with the might of an entire army.","icon":"icon/light_cone/23031.png","preview":"image/light_cone_preview/23031.png","portrait":"image/light_cone_portrait/23031.png"}
