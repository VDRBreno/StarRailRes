At the start of each wave, applies #6[i] stack(s) of \"Interpretation\" to a random enemy target, prioritizing Elite enemy targets or higher. When the Enhanced Skill's primary target has \"Interpretation,\" the multiplier for the DMG dealt increases, with each stack granting an increase of #1[f1]%/#2[f1]% on the primary target/other targets respectively. If 2 or more characters follow the Path of Erudition in the team, each stack grants an additional increase of #1[f1]%/#2[f1]% on the primary target/other targets respectively. \"Interpretation\" can stack up to #3[i] time(s). When using the Enhanced Skill, resets the number of \"Interpretation\" stacks on the primary target to 1. After the enemy target leaves the battle or gets defeated by any unit, \"Interpretation\" will be transferred, prioritizing the transfer to Elite-level targets and above.","params":[[0.04,0.02,42,1,42,25],[0.044,0.022,42,1,42,25],[0.048,0.024,42,1,42,25],[0.052,0.026,42,1,42,25],[0.056,0.028,42,1,42,25],[0.06,0.03,42,1,42,25],[0.065,0.0325,42,1,42,25],[0.07,0.035,42,1,42,25],[0.075,0.0375,42,1,42,25],[0.08,0.04,42,1,42,25],[0.084,0.042,42,1,42,25],[0.088,0.044,42,1,42,25],[0.092,0.046,42,1,42,25],[0.096,0.048,42,1,42,25],[0.1,0.05,42,1,42,25]],"icon":"icon/skill/1401_talent.png"}
